# Receipt Printer Transmissions for Haunting of Ypsilon-14

"Transmissions" printed onto a receipt printer for Mothership's Haunting of Ypsilon-14.
Each player rolls a d6 on reaching the station where the trasmission has been sent to the base.

Printer can be run with eg
```
python catprinter\print.py 01-worrying_parents\01-worrying_parents.png
```

After buying the Mothership boxset and spending days pouring over pamphlets, I still had a few weeks before we could schedule a session.
I had a cheap alibaba thermal receipt printer from a previous project along with many rolls of (yes PVC free) paper.

It was a lot of fun writing these, Ypsilon-14 is two sides of A4 so trying to place it in a world takes some imagination. The messages are set in a relatively grounded "expanse-style" solar system, at least one with simplified Marsian spelling.
They were though fairly painstaking to lay them out as it was done in Aseprite. Maybe this could be code if I wanted to do more.
